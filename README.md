# Valve FM

Vintage FM radio TUI for streaming stations from radio-browser.info.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew tap zorig/tap
brew install valvefm
```

### Chocolatey (Windows) soon!

```powershell
choco install valvefm
```

### From source

## Requirements

- **Go 1.24+**
- **Audio Backend:** Built-in pure Go MP3 player (no external deps).
- **Optional:** `mpv` or `ffplay` for AAC/OGG support and better streaming stability.
  - Windows: automatically downloads `ffplay.exe` if needed.

## Run (TUI + Tray)

```bash
go run ./cmd/radio-tray
```

Notes:

- The app always runs with the tray enabled.
- macOS/Linux socket path: `~/.config/valvefm/ctl.sock`
- Windows address file: `~/.config/valvefm/ctl.addr`
- Windows auto-downloads `ffplay.exe` on first run if no player is found.

### ⚠️ Windows SmartScreen Warning
When running `valvefm-windows-amd64.exe` for the first time, Windows might show a "Windows protected your PC" warning because the app is unsigned.
1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.
(This is normal for open-source software without an expensive code signing certificate.)

### Windows build note

If you want the TUI visible, build without the GUI subsystem:

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o valvefm.exe ./cmd/radio-tray
```
